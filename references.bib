  abstract = "The increase in number and variety of malware samples amplifies
              the need for improvement in automatic detection and classification
              of the malware variants. Machine learning is a natural choice to
              cope with this increase, because it addresses the need of
              discovering underlying patterns in large-scale datasets. Nowadays,
              neural network methodology has been grown to the state that can
              surpass limitations of previous machine learning methods, such as
              Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines. As a consequence,
              neural networks can now offer superior classification accuracy in
              many domains, such as computer vision or natural language
              processing. This improvement comes from the possibility of
              constructing neural networks with a higher number of potentially
              diverse layers and is known as Deep Learning.",
