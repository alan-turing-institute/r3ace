  title = {Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment},
  year = {2004},
  publisher = {USENIX Association},
  address = {USA},
  abstract = {Existing systems for software deployment are neither safe nor
              sufficiently flexible. Primary safety issues are the inability to
              enforce reliable specification of component dependencies, and the
              lack of support for multiple versions or variants of a component.
              This renders deployment operations such as upgrading or deleting
              components dangerous and unpredictable. A deployment system must
              also be flexible (i.e., policy-free) enough to support both
              centralised and local package management, and to allow a variety of
              mechanisms for transferring components. In this paper we present
              Nix, a deployment system that addresses these issues through a
              simple technique of using cryptographic hashes to compute unique
              paths for component instances.},
